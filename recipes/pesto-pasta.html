    <hr>
    <p>Pesto pasta is a vibrant and flavorful dish where al dente pasta is tossed in a lush, basil-based sauce made with fresh basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. The aromatic pesto coats the pasta strands, creating a luxurious and herbaceous flavor profile that's both refreshing and satisfying. With its vibrant green hue and aromatic essence, pesto pasta is a delightful fusion of simplicity and sophistication on a plate.</p>
